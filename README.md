After learning basic encryption techniques I wanted to do a little bit more than just the basic 1-1 substitution cyphering.
I came up with the idea of splitting every word into 3 parts: the first letter, middle letters and last letter.
Each part gets its own scrambled aray of the alphabet.
By keeping track of what position each letter of the alphabet is in you can substitute the random letter from the scramled array with each part of the word and decypher it later. 
The keys are the scrambled arrays and the index position of each letter in that scrambled array will allow the program to decypher it. 
I Made this visual diagram to help understand the idea.
